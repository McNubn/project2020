Aim - Create a program that will analyse the Fisher's Irish data set. 

Three main parts:
    1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in the README (using markdown for formatting).
    2. Download the data set and add it to the repo.
    3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
        a. outputs a summary of each file to a single text file,
        b. saves a histogram of each variable to png files,
        c. outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
    
Deadline - April 30th 2020 (last commit must be made on this date)

Minimum Viable Project:
    Standard repo that contains a README, a Python script, a summary text file and images. 
    The README should contain a summary of the data set and my investigations into it.
    It should also clearly document how to run the Python code and what the code does.
    Remember to referece everything - e.g. where I found a code snippet.

Better Project:
    Well organised with detailed explanations.
    Well conceived analysis, and discussion of examples of interesting analyses carried by others (with references).
