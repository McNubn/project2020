What libraries will I need for this?

pandas - dataframes
matplotlib - plotting dataset onto graphs and charts 
numpy 
seaborn

What libraries should I consider?
scikit-learn - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn
    Seems to be associated with datasets such as Fisher's Irish data set.
    Need to learn more about when to use it and how.
