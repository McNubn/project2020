# Fisher's Iris Data Set Analysis

# Introduction

This repo contains the famous Fisher's Iris Data set (iris_csv.csv), a program that will create a number of plots (the .png files) alongside summary statistics (analysis.txt), and the aforementioned files created by the program.

## How to use this GitHub repository?
- this README will introduce you to the data set, my observations from the plots I have performed, as well as referencing research on this data set by others.
- [how to run the program and navigate]

## What is Fisher's Iris Data set?

Explain what the data set is, what variables it contains, when it was done, etc.

## Why is this data set used?

Good introduction to multivariate data analysis.
Also used as an introductory data set for machine learning and such.
Evidenced by how frequently it comes up as examples for using matplotlib, seaborn and teach data analysis. Also found it mentioned in statistics study.

## Any controversies regarding this data set?

Mention the concerns regarding Iris sepals - are they really sepals?
Also mention the data was collected by someone else.

# Creation of the program

## Libraries used & why

Pandas - creating and managing dataframes
matplotlib.pyplot - plottiing dataframes to graphs
seaborn - added new styles of plots that aren't as readily available in matplotlib.pyplot



## Plots used & evolution of those plots in my code

Histograms - Total Data > Histograms by Iris type
Scatter Plot - Total Date > Colouring by Iris type
Boxplots - 
Catplot - 
Pairplot - 

Mention use of for loops, if statements, dataframe slicing (to create the 3 categories of Iris), function (nameFormat & scatter), file management (writing to analysis.txt). Discuss why I used these for this purpose.

# Analysis - Findings

## Various plots and what we can read from them

Talk through each plot and what it shows. Highlight what we see in the initial histograms and scatter plots versus the newer ones.

## Summary of overall picture from above points

What do all of these tell us? How can we be sure we're looking at a particular type of Iris.

# Research conducted by others

## Their findings & how it aligns/doesn't with mine
